eDEX-UI is a fullscreen, cross-platform terminal emulator and system monitor that looks and feels like a sci-fi computer interface.



## Useful commands for the nerds

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** the following instructions are meant for running eDEX from the latest unoptimized, unreleased, development version. If you'd like to get stable software instead, refer to [these](#how-do-i-get-it) instructions.

#### Starting from source:
on *nix systems (You'll need the Xcode command line tools on macOS):
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-linux`
- `npm run start`

on Windows:
- start cmd or powershell **as administrator**
- clone the repository
- `npm run install-windows`
- `npm run start`

#### Building
Note: Due to native modules, you can only build targets for the host OS you are using.

- `npm install` (NOT `install-linux` or `install-windows`)
- `npm run build-linux` or `build-windows` or `build-darwin`
